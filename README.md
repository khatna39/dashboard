# Topic: Lab 06: Covid-19 cases in the US

For this project, I decided to make a dashboard that consists of a proportional symbol map showing Covid-19 cases around the US at the county level. I think a proportional symbol map is best for absolute counts like covid cases and it would better represent scale by data value. (For example, it avoids making counties with larger area look more severe than actually it is.) It also shows a bar graph that displays number of counties that are in the covid cases limits for a selected area of the map. For example, in the midwest, there could be 67 counties with Covid cases of 10000 and 100 counties with Covid cases of 5000.
